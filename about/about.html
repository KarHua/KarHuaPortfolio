            <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Welcome to BonTon! We created Love and Lemons to celebrate how nourishing, fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. We hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way. You&apos;ll find a host of inventive vegetarian recipes for  breakfast, lunch and dinner, but we also want BonTon to be a resource for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and tips for cooking plant-based basics like quinoa  rice  and lentils
                <br><br>
                And after all those veggies, we always save room for dessert! In our opinion, healthy eating is all about balance, so you&apos;ll find recipes for brownies, cakes, cookies, and more.</p>

                    <h3>Are you on social media?</h3>
                    <p>You betcha! Follow along on Instagram, Twitter, or Pinterest.</p>
                <hr>
                    <h3>Where do you grocery shop?</h3>
                    <p>Based in Chicogo, in the summertime, we have fantastic local farmers markets and CSA options here. Our favorites are the Lincoln Park and Logan Square markets. But because of Chicago&apos;s cold climate, these markets aren&apos;t open year-round. In the winter, we shop at a nearby ALDI, Whole Foods, and/or Trader Joe&apos;s. We also love ordering pantry staples from Thrive Market.</p>
                <hr>
                    <h3>Do you have a cookbook?</h3>
                    <p>We have two - BonTon Every Day and The BonTon Cookbook. The main difference between the two is that The BonTon Cookbook is organized by vegetable, A to Z, while Love and Lemons Every Day is organized by meal type - breakfast, dinner, dessert, etc.</p>
